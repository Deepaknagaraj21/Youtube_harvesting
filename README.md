# Youtube_harvesting
YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing" project. This project is designed to showcase a comprehensive data pipeline built using Python, MongoDB, SQL, and Streamlit.
Key Components:

YouTube Data Harvesting: Python scripts are used to interact with the YouTube Data API, allowing us to retrieve information such as video metadata, comments, likes, and views. The collected data is then processed and prepared for storage.

MongoDB: MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is used as the primary data storage solution. It provides flexibility in handling unstructured data, making it suitable for storing the diverse information obtained from YouTube.

SQL Database: Alongside MongoDB, we employ a traditional SQL database, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL, to store structured data and perform relational queries. This combination of NoSQL and SQL databases enables us to harness the advantages of both paradigms.

Streamlit Dashboard: The Streamlit framework is utilized to create an interactive and user-friendly dashboard. Users can access insights and visualizations derived from the collected data in real-time. Streamlit's simplicity makes it easy to deploy the dashboard for anyone to use.
